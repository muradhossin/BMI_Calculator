# Body Mass Index Calculator

Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a personâ€™s height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years.
